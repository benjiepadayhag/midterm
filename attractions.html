                Fort San Pedro or formerly “real Fuerza de Iloilo” was completed in 1616. 
                All made of stone with good bulwarks and arsenal that were surrounded by big cannons.
                 Quadrilateral in shape and measured 60 by 60 meters. The walls were composed of cutouts of 
                 Guimaras rocks and coral stones from along the Panay Coast. Fort San Pedro was built to protect the city from invaders that threatened 
                 Iloilo such as Dutch and Moro pirates. The disrepair of the fort started in the early 20th century and was totally destroyed during World War II.
