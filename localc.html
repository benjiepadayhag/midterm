                <h3>Lapaz Batchoy</h3>
                <p>
                    Do you also crave noodles with hot broth to sip when it's raining or on cold days? 
                    Originating from La Paz, Iloilo City, Lapaz Batchoy is a prominent dish that Filipinos
                     and even tourists should try. With its rich chicken broth, rounded noodles, pork organs, 
                     beef loin, and shrimp stock, garnished with chicharrón, it's not just an eye-catcher but 
                     also a definite chef's kiss! Lapaz Batchoy is the kind of food that provides comfort, 
                    especially on cold nights, making you crave it for the warmth it brings.

                <h3>Pancit Molo</h3>
                <p>
                    If trending foreign soup dishes have you thinking about local alternatives, 
                    fear not! Iloilo City offers the local counterpart of Chinese wonton soup—the Pancit Molo. 
                    Originating in the heart of Iloilo City, in the district of Molo, Pancit Molo features locally-made dumplings 
                    with shredded chicken or sea flavors from crabs and shrimp. Unlike traditional pancit, it doesn't have the look of noodles, 
                    as the noodle is actually the molo ball wrappers, which have the same recipe as making noodles.

                <h3>Valenciana</h3>
                <p>
                    You probably crave something heavy like rice. Iloilo has your back with its local counterpart 
                    of paella—Valenciana! Perfect for occasions such as fiestas, reunions, and birthdays, 
                    Valenciana is made up of malagkit (sticky) rice, pork, chorizo, and comes with beautiful garnishes such as eggs, 
                    peas, bell peppers, and raisins. You wont go home hungry after visiting friends or relatives in the Philippines, 
                    as they will enthusiastically offer you fulfilling meals such as Valenciana.

                <h3>Bitso-Bitso</h3>
                <p>
                    After all those fulfilling and heavy meals, missing dessert would be a pity! If South Korea offers twisted donuts, 
                    Iloilo City offers bitso-bitso. Made of rice flour, twisted and deep-fried, then dipped in muscovado sugar syrup, 
                    bitso-bitso is the perfect dessert 
                    to complete your meal during your stay in Iloilo City, whether you're a tourist or a fellow countryman.

                <h3>KBL</h3>
                <p>
                    KBL is short of Kadyos, Baboy, and Langka which translates to pigeon peas, pork, and jackfruit. 
                    Odd combination isn't it? but works deliciously. This local dish is akin to Sinigang.
                    “Kadyós, Báboy, kag Langkâ” (KBL) is an Ilónggo and an Ilocáno viand. In Ilocáno, KBL is known as “Inabráw ti Kardís”.  
                    Some individuals prefer the version.

                <h3>Binakol</h3>
                <p>
                    Binakol is the Ilonggo version of a Tinola. What makes it different, however, is 
                    it's made with coconut juice and slivers of coconut flesh, making it taste sweet. 
                    It's also cooked traditionally using bamboo tubes and served in coconut shells. It is a healthy chicken soup dish that resembles tinola,
                     except that this is cooked using “buko”.
